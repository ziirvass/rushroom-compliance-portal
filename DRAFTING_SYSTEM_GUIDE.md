# Proposal Drafting & Tracking System — Quick Start Guide

**Status:** ✅ System implemented and ready to use  
**Date Created:** 2026-07-05  
**Location:** Digital Builds workspace  

---

## What Is This System?

A comprehensive framework for **proposing, tracking, and implementing** new features and enhancements for the Rushroom Compliance Portal.

**Core Concept:** Never again lose track of good ideas. Every proposal is documented with its:
- **Cause:** What problem does it solve?
- **Effect:** What changes would happen?
- **Implications:** Risks, dependencies, effort, performance impact
- **Status:** Draft → Proposed → In Progress → Implemented
- **Tracking:** Linked to git commits for implementation history

---

## System Components

### 1. **PROPOSALS.json** — Master Registry of All Ideas
**Location:** `/PROPOSALS.json`  
**Contains:** 10 initial proposals (PROP-001 through PROP-010)  
**Format:** JSON array of proposal objects  
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for all proposals

**Initial Proposals Included:**
1. **PROP-001** — Phase 5 Frontend UI (IMPLEMENTED)
2. **PROP-002** — Real-time Compliance Matrix Updates (DRAFT)
3. **PROP-003** — Bulk Interpretation Workflow (DRAFT)
4. **PROP-004** — Deviation Trend Analysis & Patterns (DRAFT)
5. **PROP-005** — Auto DPP Generation (DRAFT)
6. **PROP-006** — AI-Suggested Compliance Status (DRAFT)
7. **PROP-007** — Multi-Language Support (DRAFT)
8. **PROP-008** — Interpretation Version Control (DRAFT)
9. **PROP-009** — Scheduled Compliance Scans (DRAFT)
10. **PROP-010** — ESPR Compliance Path Tracing (PROPOSED, HIGH priority)

### 2. **SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.html** — Visual Proposal Browser
**Location:** Section 12 in `/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.html`

- Effort and priority at-a-glance
- Beautiful HTML rendering (printable to PDF)

### 3. **IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md** — Tracking Implementations
**Location:** `/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`  
**Contains:** Detailed log of implementation progress  
**Purpose:** Track which proposals were implemented, in which commits, and learnings  

**Information Per Proposal:**
- Current status and estimated completion
- Commit hashes when implemented
- What was actually done vs. what was proposed
- Learnings and recommendations
- Percentage complete (0-100%)

### 4. **PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.md** — Guide for Adding New Proposals
**Location:** `/PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.md`  
**Contains:** Detailed template with field definitions and examples  
**Purpose:** Help create new proposals consistently  

**Includes:**

## How to Use: The Workflow

### **Scenario 1: You Have an Idea**

1. **Read PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.md** to understand the format
2. **Create a new proposal object** in your head:
   - What problem does it solve? (cause)
   - What would change? (effect)
   - How much effort? How risky?
3. **Add to PROPOSALS.json** (append to array)
4. **Set status to "draft"** (not yet reviewed)
5. **Commit:**
   ```bash
   git add PROPOSALS.json
   git commit -m "docs: add PROP-XXX: [Brief Title]"
   ```

### **Scenario 2: Review Proposals (Decide What to Build)**

1. **Open SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.html** in browser
2. **Scroll to Section 12: Proposals & Drafts**
3. **Read the proposals** — color-coded cards show status/priority
4. **Review cause/effect/implications** to assess value
5. **Decide:**
   - Yes → Update status from `draft` → `proposed`
   - No → Update status to `rejected`
   - Maybe → Leave as `draft` for later review

**Update status in PROPOSALS.json:**
```json
"status": "proposed"  // or "implemented", "rejected", etc.
```

### **Scenario 3: Start Implementation**

1. **Find the proposal** in PROPOSALS.json
2. **Update status to "in_progress"**
3. **Add to IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md:**
   ```markdown
   ### PROP-XXX: [Feature Name]
   - **Status:** ⏳ IN PROGRESS
   - **Commits:** (will fill in as you develop)
   - **Implementation Notes:**
     - Working on [task 1]
     - Planning to [task 2]
   ```
4. **Start coding** (all normal git workflow)
5. **As you commit, note the commit hash:**
   ```json
   "commits_implemented": [
     "abc1234 feat: add renderStandardDetails()",
     "def5678 feat: add interpretation editor"
   ]
   ```

### **Scenario 4: Complete Implementation**

1. **Update PROPOSALS.json:**
   ```json
   "status": "implemented",
   "percentage_complete": 100
   ```
2. **Add final commits to array:**
   ```json
   "commits_implemented": [
     "abc1234 feat: add renderStandardDetails()",
     "def5678 feat: add interpretation editor",
     "ghi9012 test: add unit tests"
   ]
   ```
3. **Update IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md:**
   ```markdown
   - **Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
   - **Commits:** [list above]
   - **Learnings:** 
     - [What worked well]
     - [What was harder than expected]
     - [Recommendations for similar features]
   ```
4. **Commit:**
   ```bash
   git add PROPOSALS.json IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md
   git commit -m "feat: implement PROP-XXX - [Description]"
   ```

## Key Features of This System

### ✅ **Capture Ideas Before They're Lost**
Write down proposals when you think of them, not later.

### ✅ **Document Reasoning (Cause & Effect)**
Every proposal explicitly states:
- What problem it solves
- What would change
- Why it's worth doing

### ✅ **Flag Implications Upfront**
Before starting work, consider:
- Effort estimate (realistic)
- Risk level (do we know how to do it?)
- Dependencies (does other work need to be done first?)
- Performance impact (will it slow down the system?)
- User training (do users need to learn new workflows?)

### ✅ **Track Status Through Lifecycle**
- Draft (idea stage)
- Proposed (approved for consideration)
- In Progress (actively being built)
- Implemented (complete and deployed)
- Rejected (decision not to do it)

### ✅ **Link Proposals to Git Commits**
Never lose the connection between a proposal and the code that implemented it.

### ✅ **Capture Learnings**
When done, document:
- What actually happened vs. what was proposed
- Time estimate accuracy (did it take 3 hours or 6?)
- Recommendations for similar features
- Gotchas or insights discovered

### ✅ **Visual Browser (SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.html)**
Beautiful HTML cards make it easy to:
- Browse proposals
- Assess priority/effort
- Make decisions
- Print to PDF for stakeholder review

## Tips for Success

### 📋 **Before Proposing**
- Check if similar proposals already exist
- Understand the cause (what problem are we really solving?)
- Think through implications (effort, risk, dependencies)
- Be honest about time estimates (overestimate rather than underestimate)

### 💡 **When Proposing**
- One proposal = one feature (don't combine multiple ideas)
- Be specific about cause/effect (avoid vague statements)
- Flag dependencies early (what else needs to happen first?)
- Suggest phase/timeline (when could this realistically be done?)

### 🚀 **When Implementing**
- Track time actually spent vs. estimated (helps calibrate future estimates)
- Add commit hashes as you go (don't wait until the end)
- Document learnings (what was harder/easier than expected?)
- Update percentage_complete as you progress (0→25→50→75→100)

### ✅ **When Complete**
- Update status to "implemented"
- List all commits involved
- Document learnings (what did we learn?)
- Note any changes to original proposal (what we actually built vs. planned)

## Integration with Git Workflow

### **Proposal Creation**
```bash
# Edit PROPOSALS.json, add new proposal object
git add PROPOSALS.json
git commit -m "docs: add PROP-XXX: [Title]"
```

### **Start Implementation**
```bash
# Update status to "in_progress"
git add PROPOSALS.json IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md
git commit -m "docs: start PROP-XXX implementation"
```

### **During Development**
```bash
# Normal commits for the feature
git add <files>
git commit -m "feat: implement [feature name]"
# (Track commit hash and add to PROPOSALS.json later)
```

### **Mark Complete**
```bash
# Update status to "implemented", add commits, update learnings
git add PROPOSALS.json IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md
git commit -m "feat: complete PROP-XXX - [Description]"
```

## Examples from Current System

### Example: PROP-001 (Implemented)
- **Status:** IMPLEMENTED (shipped in commits 9aec605, 91eb470)
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Effort:** 4 hours
- **Cause:** Backend API ready, but no UI
- **Effect:** 4 new UI functions (Standard Details, Interpretation Editor, Compliance Matrix, Passport View)
- **Implications:** Low risk (APIs tested), no dependencies
- **Next:** Done — shipped as the "Clauses & DPP" tab (renderLevel2 + l2* views)

### Example: PROP-010 (High Value, Not Yet Started)
- **Status:** PROPOSED
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Effort:** 8 hours
- **Cause:** Regulators will ask how we ensure ESPR compliance
- **Effect:** Visual tracing from regulation clause → implementation → DPP
- **Implications:** High regulatory value, depends on Phase 5 completion
- **Next:** Schedule for Phase 6 (after PROP-001 done)

### Example: PROP-007 (Defer for Now)
- **Status:** DRAFT
- **Priority:** LOW
- **Effort:** 10 hours
- **Cause:** International company, potential user demand
- **Effect:** Multi-language support (EN, DE, SV)
- **Implications:** Large effort, unclear if users need it
- **Recommendation:** Defer to Phase 6, reassess when user demand confirmed

## Quick Decision Matrix

**When should you implement a proposal?**

```
HIGH priority + LOW effort → Do immediately
    Examples: PROP-006 (2h), PROP-005 (3h)

HIGH priority + HIGH effort → Schedule for next phase
    Examples: PROP-010 (8h), PROP-001 (4h, already scheduled)

MEDIUM priority + LOW effort → Add to backlog for Phase 5b/6
    Examples: PROP-002 (3h), PROP-004 (4h)

MEDIUM priority + HIGH effort → Discuss with team, deprioritize if possible
    Examples: PROP-003 (6h), PROP-008 (5h)

LOW priority + HIGH effort → Defer indefinitely, revisit annually
    Examples: PROP-007 (10h multi-language)

LOW priority + LOW effort → Nice-to-have, implement if bored
    Examples: PROP-006 (2h)
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 5:** Implement PROP-001 (Frontend UI)
2. **During Phase 5:** Consider adding PROP-006 if time permits (easy win)
3. **After Phase 5:** Review PROP-010 (ESPR Tracing) for Phase 6 planning
4. **Ongoing:** Add new proposals as ideas arise
5. **Before new phases:** Review proposal status and reprioritize
