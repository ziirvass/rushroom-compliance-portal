  /* ---- Live status source ------------------------------------------------
   * Published CSV URL of the action-plan Google Sheet
   * ("00_ACTION_PLAN_Rushroom_Compliance_Step_by_Step").
   * In the Sheet:  File → Share → Publish to web → (whole sheet) → CSV → Publish,
   * then paste the generated link here. Leave "" to use the bundled snapshot below.
   *
   * The parser reads the action-plan's own columns (case-insensitive, any order):
   *   Step | Phase | ACTION — what Rushroom must do | Who does it |
   *   Where / how | Output / evidence | Folder | Priority | Status
   * It also accepts the simpler aliases: action, owner, evidence, priority, status.
   *   - Status:   anything containing "done" → complete; "active"/"in progress" →
   *               in progress; "blocked" → blocked; otherwise "open".
   *   - Priority: a "BLOCKER" or "gate" priority marks a pre-sale blocker.
   *   - Audience (optional column): comma-separated, e.g. "internal, supplier".
   *               If absent, supplier relevance is inferred from the step text.
   *
   * The URL below is the action-plan sheet's CSV endpoint. It activates as soon
   * as the Sheet is shared "Anyone with the link → Viewer" (Share button, top
   * right of the Sheet). Until then the portal shows the bundled snapshot and
   * explains how to enable live status — nothing breaks.
   * Most reliable alternative if the gviz endpoint is ever blocked:
   *   File → Share → Publish to web → (whole sheet) → CSV → Publish,
   * then paste that ".../pub?output=csv" link here instead.
