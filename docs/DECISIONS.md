# Rushroom — Architectural Decisions Log
_Append-only. Claude Code appends one entry here after every /ship._

**Date:** 2026-07-10
**Feature:** Dev system setup
**Decision:** Converted schema.sql to 6 numbered migration files in supabase/migrations/. Seeds moved to supabase/seed.sql. organization_id backfill removed from migration path — SET NOT NULL works because tables are empty at migration time, seeds insert with organization_id supplied directly.
**Why:** Fresh databases (new customers, local dev, CI) must apply migrations then seeds in order. Embedding seeds in migrations would insert dev data into customer databases on supabase db push.
**Files changed:** supabase/migrations/0001–0006, supabase/seed.sql, supabase/schema.sql

**Date:** 2026-07-10
**Feature:** Migration workflow verification
**Decision:** supabase db push --local confirmed working. All 6 migration files (0001–0006) apply cleanly to a fresh database. supabase db diff --local returns "No schema changes found" — local DB matches migrations exactly. All 25 tables present and correct.
**Why:** Needed to verify the documented workflow was proven, not just correct on paper. Local Docker + Supabase CLI used as test environment before touching production.
**Files changed:** none — verification only
